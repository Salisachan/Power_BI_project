# Power BI Report Overview

## Introduction

This report overview will walk you through what is in the report. There are four distinct pages in the report, each designed to provide valuable insights and visualizations based on the data it analyzes. The report is structured as follows:

1. **Executive Dashboard**: This page offers a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and critical metrics. It serves as a quick snapshot of the overall performance.

2. **Product Insights**: Building upon the Executive Dashboard, this page provides detailed insights into products. It is dynamically filtered by the top 10 products highlighted in the Executive Dashboard.

3. **Worldwide Orders Map**: Visualize total orders from different countries on this page. This dynamic map provides a geographical representation of order distribution worldwide.

4. **Customer Details**: Delve into customer-centric insights on this page. Explore metrics such as average revenue per customer, total customer count, and identify the top customers by revenue.

This `README.md` file will guide you through accessing and interacting with the report effectively.
