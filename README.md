Welcome to my Power BI portfolio project repository! In this project, I've leveraged Microsoft's sample database, which represents data from a bike shop company called Adventureworks. This dataset includes various tables, including customer data, calendar information, product details, sales data, and more. The primary focus of this repository is to showcase my skills in using Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Introduction
Power BI is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, and this project demonstrates my ability to work with diverse datasets and present meaningful insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project comprises several tables and is **simulated** data for a fictional bike shop company. It is important to note that this dataset is **not** derived from real-life data but has been created solely for the purpose of showcasing my skills in using Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

1. **Customer Table:** Contains information about the customers, including their names, contact details, and location.

2. **Calendar Table:** Provides a date dimension for time-based analysis, including dates, months, quarters, and years.

3. **Product Table:** Contains data on various products offered by the bike shop, including product names, descriptions, and prices.

4. **Product Subcategories Table:** Categorizes products into subcategories for better organization and analysis.

5. **Product Categories Table:** Further categorizes products into broader categories.

6. **Return Data Table:** Tracks product returns, including return dates and reasons for return.

7. **Territory Table:** Contains information about sales territories and regions.

8. **Sales Table:** A fact table that records sales transactions, including sales dates, product IDs, customer IDs, and quantities.

9. **Return Data Table:** Another fact table that records product returns, including return dates, product IDs, customer IDs, and reasons for return.

This simulated dataset serves as a suitable foundation for demonstrating various Power BI data manipulation and visualization techniques.## Objectives

The primary objectives of this portfolio project are as follows:

- **Data Cleaning:** Explore and clean the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and any other data quality issues.

- **Data Transformation:** Perform data transformations and create relationships between tables to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** Develop interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI to visualize key insights from the dataset.
